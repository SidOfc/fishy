This is a fishing tracker which groups caught fish by areas and subzones.
The tracking panel will show up automatically when you start fishing.
Tracking information is saved per character, there is no account wide tracker.
Type `/fishy` (alias `/fs`) to see available commands.

Fishy supports auto looting BoP items when the auto loot setting is enabled.
When your inventory is full Fishy will still attempt to auto loot but will no longer hide the loot window.
